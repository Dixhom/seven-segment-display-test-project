# Seven-segment display test project

# What Is This?
A project to display floating point numbers on 4 [seven-segment displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display).

# Goal?
Given a number like 1.23, to display something like [ ][1].[2][3] on the seven-segment displays.

# Difficulty?
- Efficient wiring to save pins since connecting 4x7=28 electrodes of the displays to a microcontroller would use up all the pins.
- Good algorithm to convert a floating point number in a program to the flashing of each LED segment on the display.
